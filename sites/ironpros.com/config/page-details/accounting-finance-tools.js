Software in a number of categories may also perform this function, including field service management and field productivity which will capture labor, parts, and other expenses of work as they are realized.</p><p>A robust project-drive enterprise resource planning (ERP) software will have tools for managing job costs, but the challenge is capturing data from all of the sources of costâ€”procurement, subcontracting, equipment, and labor. This is where software used for construction operations becomes a crucial part of the mix.</p></div></div></div>',
