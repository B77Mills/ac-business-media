These technologies may also capture condition information either through vibration or temperature sensors or accelerometers or from a piece of equipment’s telematics unit. GPS Asset Tracking & Fleet Management software for construction can be used to track:</p><p><ul><li>Heavy or light equipment with their own telematics unit</li><li>Powered equipment with no telematics through sensors provided by the software vendor</li><li>Unpowered assets, where sensors will need their own batteries and may include battery-saving features to extend life</li></ul></p><p><strong>GPS Asset Management with Construction Equipment Maintenance</strong></p><p>Some software harnesses GPS location and operations data to inform maintenance, and may have functionality for planned maintenance management, technician staffing, spares and repairs, maintenance scheduling, and even rostering for maintenance technicians against demand. Some software vendors are beginning to explore predictive maintenance, mostly be exposing more advanced data sets from OEMs. IRONPROS is watching for advancements that will expose the maintenance history, either within a given construction organization or across a dealer or OEM’s customer base, for prescriptive or prognostic maintenance.</p><p><strong>GPS Asset Management with Asset Accounting</strong></p><p>Some software connects equipment data to financial data in a construction enterprise resource planning (ERP) software application. This may:</p><p><ul><li>Support cost accounting for maintenance, parts and operation</li><li>Inform fix-or-replace decisions</li><li>Enable profitable decisions on major refits</li><li>Allow a leadership team to compare demand for productivity with the productive capacity of the fleet</li></ul></p><p><strong>GPS Asset Management for Project Control</strong></p><p>Data from connected construction equipment can inform not just maintenance, but project management activities as the location, pace and activities of equipment are captured, influencing dispatching, scheduling and site communications.</p></div></div></div></div>',
