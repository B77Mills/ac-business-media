This may be in support of equipment installation, inspections, break-fix repair or planned maintenance. While the line is blurring between field service management software and another product category, field productivity software, field service software will go deeper into routing, scheduling, and management of a workforce to meet service level agreements (SLAs) and other contractual obligations with customers.</p><p>The software will typically encompass dispatching, routing, scheduling, technician credentials, service and van inventory, and more. There may be functionality for reverse logistics, drop location inventory, or AI-driven optimized drip scheduling.</p><p>MEP, HVACR, and other contractors executing against annual service contracts will want field service management software, as will many home service contractors.</p></div></div></div>',
