Initially, construction AR/VR was a tool for designers to present projects to owners and stakeholders, and it still does that. Ruggedized headsets are bringing construction AR/VR to the field to help locate buried utilities or ensure project elements are placed precisely according to a model. Some construction AR/VR software will also offer a mixed reality solution, so site-based workers can see elements of a plan, a point cloud or other data sources superimposed on reality through their smartphone camera.</p></div></div></div>',
