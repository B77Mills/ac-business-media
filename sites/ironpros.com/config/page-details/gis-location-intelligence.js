GIS is essential for construction. Construction contractors may have access to multiple information streams—maps of utility locations, project boundaries, drone survey data with elevations—GIS can combine them all into a single view in context. GIS will underpin municipal or large project or asset records, but during construction, mobile GIS tools will be important to provide context to users in the field. From progress reporting, as-builts, site inspection management, location of specific elements in a job site, and more, GIS is a core technology.</p></div></div></div>',
