Supply chain disruptions following the pandemic are just one factorâ€”but as contractors try to control cost and timelines, procurement efficiencies can help with both. Construction procurement software will help identify purchasing requirements from project plans and connect contractors with vendors in a collaborative environment for pricing and availability. These software products can address specific industries, with many focusing on the trades including mechanical, electrical and plumbing, drywall, concrete and other disciplines where parts and materials make up a significant portion of project cost and availability constraints must be managed.</p></div></div></div>',
