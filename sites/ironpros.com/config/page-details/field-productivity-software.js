Job ticketing is a core function here as project deliverables are broken up into work packages and assigned to workers, crews, or equipment. As work is performed, that progress is tracked in field productivity software to support billing, decision support, schedule management, and other functions. IRONPROS research has found field productivity software <a href="https://ironpros.com/en-us/a/2ad2180a5aaa2d64c1ed9d81f1d9eb14/ironpros-research-finds-field-productivity-software-most-significant-construction-technology-going-into-2023">the most significant construction technology for 2023</a>.</p><p>Construction field productivity software may include functions for time clock/time reporting, photographic or other field notes, materials ticketing, presence detection, subcontractor management, and more.</p><p>In some cases, field productivity solutions are gaining functionality for field service management, and vice versa. This makes sense because contractors will often use the same workforce for project-centric work on-site and aftermarket or install work where technicians or crews visit multiple sites per day.</p></div></div></div>',
