In a hydrostatic transmission, the engine drives a hydraulic pump, which then pressurizes hydraulic fluid that drives hydraulic motors, which turn the tracks. This system allows for infinitely variable speed control and makes it easier to maneuver the dozer. One advantage of a hydrostatic drive system is its excellent control and responsiveness, allowing operators to make precise movements and adjustments. The system also allows easy control of the dozer\'s speed, acceleration, and deceleration. It can make the dozer more efficient and productive, particularly in tight spaces or when performing tasks that require careful precision. Another advantage of a hydrostatic drive system is that it can be more reliable and durable than traditional mechanical transmissions. Because there are fewer moving parts, the transmission system has less wear and tear, which can reduce maintenance costs and downtime.</p></div></div><div class="node-list node-list--section-list">  <div class="node-list__header">What is load-sensing hydraulics?</div> <div class="node-list__body"> <p>Load-sensing hydraulics is a type of hydraulic system that provides precise and efficient control of hydraulic functions by adjusting the flow and pressure of hydraulic fluid to match the needs of the load being lifted or moved. This system is commonly used in heavy machinery, such as excavators, loaders, and cranes. In a load-sensing hydraulic system, the pressure and flow of hydraulic fluid are regulated by a variable displacement pump that adjusts the amount of fluid sent to the system based on the load being lifted or moved. It allows the system to use only the needed hydraulic power, reducing energy waste and improving overall efficiency. The load-sensing hydraulic system also typically includes a pressure-compensated flow control valve that adjusts the fluid flow to each function based on the load requirements of that function. It ensures that each function receives the appropriate amount of hydraulic power, even if other functions are used simultaneously. Load-sensing hydraulics can provide several advantages over traditional hydraulic systems, including improved efficiency, reduced energy waste, and more precise control over hydraulic functions. These benefits make load-sensing hydraulics a popular choice for heavy machinery and other applications that require precise and efficient hydraulic control.</p></div></div><div class="node-list node-list--section-list">  <div class="node-list__header">Should I really care about ECO mode?</div> <div class="node-list__body"> <p>Yes, you should care about ECO mode if you want to reduce your environmental impact, save money on fuel, and potentially extend the lifespan of your equipment.

The system typically involves setting up a laser or GPS base station that sends a signal to a receiver mounted on the dozer or excavator, which adjusts the height of the blade or bucket to maintain a consistent grade. 2D grade control is helpful for simple grading tasks such as cutting slopes or excavating trenches and is generally less expensive and easier to set up than 3D grade control. 3D grade control is a more advanced system that uses multiple sensors to control the blade or bucket\'s height, slope, and angle in three dimensions - horizontal, vertical, and slope. The system typically involves installing sensors on the blade or bucket and the dozer or excavator, which work together to provide real-time feedback on the position and orientation of the blade or bucket. 3D grade control is helpful for more complex grading tasks such as creating roadways, building foundations, and excavation work, and it is generally more expensive and more difficult to set up than 2D grade control. In summary, the main difference between 2D and 3D grade control is the level of precision and accuracy they provide. While both systems are designed to help achieve accurate and precise grading, 3D grade control is more advanced and provides more detailed information about the position and orientation of the blade or bucket, making it better suited for complex grading tasks.</p></div></div><div class="node-list node-list--section-list">  <div class="node-list__header">What kind of blades are available for dozers?</div> <div class="node-list__body"> <p>Different blades are available for dozers, each designed for specific grading and earthmoving tasks.
