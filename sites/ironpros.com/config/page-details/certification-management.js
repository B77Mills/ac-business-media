It can also ensure a subcontractor has insurance certificates to perform on a project. Certification management is often built into project management, ERP or field service management software. Advanced scheduling software will rely on certification management to ensure only workers with the proper credentials are assigned to tasks. Stand-alone insurance certificate management software can automate the process of comparing not just the presence and expiration date of an insurance certificate but the indemnities with the requirements of a project.</p></div></div></div>',
