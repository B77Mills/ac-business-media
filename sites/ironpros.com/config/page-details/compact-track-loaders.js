Let us explain the difference between vertical and radial lift arms.</p><p><strong>Vertical Lift Arms:</strong></p><p>A vertical lift arm moves up and down in a straight line, perpendicular to the ground. It provides maximum lift height at the hinge pin, allowing the loader to reach higher levels and efficiently load material into high-sided trucks or bins. Vertical lift arms also offer excellent stability when carrying heavy loads, making them suitable for lifting pallets or carrying large loads of debris or dirt.</p><p><strong>Radial Lift Arms:</strong></p><p>A radial lift arm moves in an arc, providing excellent reach at mid-range lift heights. It provides better forward reach than a vertical lift arm, making it suitable for loading and unloading flatbed trucks or carrying material over obstacles. Radial lift arms also offer better visibility to the operator, making it easier to maneuver the loader in tight spaces.</p><p>To summarize, we can say that vertical lift arms provide greater lift height and stability, making them ideal for heavy lifting and loading tasks, while radial lift arms offer better reach and visibility, making them suitable for tasks that require reaching over obstacles or working in confined spaces.</p></div></div><div class="node-list node-list--section-list">  <div class="node-list__header">Should I get a loader with vertical or radial lift arms?</div>  <div class="node-list__body">    <p>If you need to lift heavy loads or work where stability is a priority, a loader with a vertical lift arm may be your best option.

A rigid undercarriage is more durable and has a more straightforward design, making it ideal for use on flat and even surfaces. It provides better stability and traction on hard surfaces and can handle heavier loads without damaging the tracks. A rigid undercarriage also requires less maintenance and is less prone to wear and tear.</p><p>On the other hand, a suspended undercarriage is more suitable for rough and uneven terrain. It provides a smoother ride, reduces shock and vibration, and minimizes the impact on the operator. A suspended undercarriage provides better traction and stability on soft, uneven surfaces like mud, sand, and gravel. However, a suspended undercarriage can be more expensive, requires more maintenance, and is vulnerable to damage.</p><p>In summary, a rigid undercarriage may be the better option for working on flat surfaces due to its durability and stability. However, a suspended undercarriage may be better if you work on rough and uneven terrain due to its smoother ride and better traction.
