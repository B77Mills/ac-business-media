Traditional BI and analytics are rear-facing. They tell you what happened in the past. Construction unfolds unpredictably in real-time, so at a minimum, construction BI and analytics just capture real-time data and present it in a way that owners, executives, and project managers can do things like:</p><p><ul><li>Course correct a project going over budget</li><li>Spot resource constraints and deal with them before they affect the budget or timeline</li><li>Ensure cash outlays to not run too far ahead of billables</li></ul></p><p>Many construction software products will often have pre-populated tools for common construction metrics including:</p><p><ul><li>Earned Value Management (EVM)—milestone-based project management important for complex projects and those for government customers</li><li>Estimate to Complete (ETC) and Estimate at Complete (EAC)—tools to project the financial position at the end of a project and the amount of cost yet to be realized given what scope elements are completed</li><li>Excess Cost Tracking and Costs in Excess of Billing—Sometimes, a contractor will bill for work that has not yet been delivered, or realize costs before that cost can be liquidated on an invoice</li></ul></p><p>Most construction software products will have analytics screens, functionality or modules built in. There are standalone construction BI and analytics tools too. Larger construction organizations may more frequently standardize on a data warehouse to better support high-volume querying and a data governance plan. Packaged, commercial-off-the-shelf construction business analytics and software will be more within reach of smaller to middle-market construction contractors.</p></div></div></div>',
