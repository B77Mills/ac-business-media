This overhang can cause the rear of the machine to swing into nearby obstacles or structures, making it challenging to work in confined spaces. However, reduced or zero tail swing models have been designed to minimize or eliminate this overhang, which allows the machine to operate within a smaller footprint without damaging nearby structures or obstacles.</p><p>Reduced tail swing excavators typically have a smaller rear overhang than regular compact excavators. It reduces the risk of hitting obstacles behind the machine while working in tight spaces. On the other hand, zero-tail swing excavators have no rear overhang, which means they can rotate 360 degrees within their footprint without hitting anything.</p><p>Reduced and zero tail swing excavators are particularly useful for working in urban environments, construction sites with limited space, and residential areas where the excavator needs to maneuver in tight spaces without damaging nearby buildings or landscaping. They are also ideal for working in confined spaces such as tunnels and indoor construction sites.</p></div></div><div class="node-list node-list--section-list">  <div class="node-list__header">Why Should You Rent a Compact Excavator?</div>  <div class="node-list__body">    <p>There are several reasons why you might want to rent a compact excavator instead of buying one:</p><p><strong>1- Flexibility:</strong></p><p>Renting a compact excavator allows you to choose a suitable machine without committing to a long-term investment.
